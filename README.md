# CSV Query Playground

Welcome to the **CSV Query Playground**! 🎉 This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## What Does This App Do? 🤔

Ever wanted to play around with CSV files like a pro? Well, now you can! With the CSV Query Playground, you can:

- **Upload** your CSV files with ease.
- **Parse** them into beautiful, structured data.
- **Filter** the data to your heart's content.
- **View** the results in a sleek, paginated table.
- **Advertise** (because why not?) with our cool ad section.

It's like having a mini data lab right in your browser! 🧪

## Getting Started 🚀

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
